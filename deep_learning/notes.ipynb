    "#### Backgroud: Why CNN?\n",
    "While Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) introduced the fundamental structure of deep learning with input, hidden, and output layers, they face significant challenges when applied to image data. Processing high-dimensional images with fully connected layers leads to enormous computational complexity and a high risk of overfitting. To address these limitations, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were developed. Inspired by the visual processing mechanisms of the human brain, CNNs efficiently capture spatial hierarchies and local patterns in images while dramatically reducing the number of parameters, making them well-suited for tasks such as image recognition, object detection, and other computer vision applications.\n",
